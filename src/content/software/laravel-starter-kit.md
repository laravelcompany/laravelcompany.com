## 🧰 Key Features That Make Starter Stand Out

### 🔧 **Live Editing**
Starter lets you edit everything visually and in real-time – padding, margin, shadows, borders, fonts, and more – all through a simple double-click interface.

### 🤖 **AI Integration**
Generate text and images with AI directly inside the builder. You can even limit token usage per user, giving you full control over how AI resources are consumed.

### 📦 **Pre-Built Templates + Custom Uploads**
Includes 20+ ready-to-use templates, plus you can upload any HTML or Bootstrap-based layout and customise it within the editor.

### 🧱 **Advanced Drag & Drop**
Move elements intuitively, reorder sections, or use the right-click context menu for precision edits like adding table rows or duplicating blocks.

### 🌍 **SaaS Mode**
Starter is built with monetization in mind. Enable SaaS features, define subscription plans, restrict access to certain modules, and start earning straight away.

### 🌗 **Dark Mode + Appearance Editor**
Comes with light and dark themes out of the box. Easily change branding, colours, landing page content, and even the site’s logo via the appearance editor.

### 💬 **Built-in Authentication**
Full login system with support for social logins (Google, Facebook, Twitter), account settings, and password recovery.

## 📈 Perfect for Builders Who Value Speed, Flexibility, and Control

Starter is not just a builder – it's a framework. With options to export projects, attach domains, or deploy via FTP, it's built for real-world development workflows. Add custom elements, extend functionality, and keep full access to the **source code** with no encryption. You own it.



## 📜 Requirements

To run Starter, you’ll need:
- PHP ≥ 8.2
- MySQL
- PDO & `fileinfo` extensions enabled (defaults on most setups)

---

## 💰 Pricing

- **Regular License**: $25 – Perfect for personal or client projects without paid access
- **Extended License**: $50 – Required if you’re selling access to the builder (e.g. SaaS model)

Both options include:
- Quality-checked code
- Free future updates
- 6 months of support from Laravel Company (extendable to 12 months)


## 🏁 Final Thoughts

Starter is a polished, well-supported, and actively updated website builder for developers who need flexibility, scalability, and modern design. With the ability to white-label, extend, and embed, it's as much a developer's toolkit as it is a designer’s playground.

Whether you're spinning up landing pages, launching a web app, or creating a builder service yourself, **Starter gives you the tools to do it fast – and do it well.**
