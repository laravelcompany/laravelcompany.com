## 🧠 What Is ECU Software, Anyway?

In simple terms:  
Your car’s **ECU (Engine Control Unit)** is its operating system. It manages:
- Fuel injection
- Ignition timing
- Emissions
- And many other internal behaviours

Using ECU software, you can connect to this brain and run diagnostics, view real-time data, and even make adjustments. Just know: **modifying settings improperly can brick your ECU** or land you in legal trouble.

## ⚖️ Legal & Safety Guidelines  

**ECU modifications may void your warranty or be illegal depending on your country.**  

| Country/Region | Legality Notes |
|----------------|----------------|
| 🇺🇸 USA         | DMCA allows personal tuning, but file sharing is murky. |
| 🇬🇧 UK          | Legal for diagnostics; tuning = off-road/motorsport use. |
| 🇨🇳 🇷🇺 Asia/Russia | Check local laws. Rules vary widely. |
| 🇦🇺 Australia    | Post-tuning compliance checks may apply. |

> 🔐 Always disconnect your SGW bypass device before visiting any authorised dealership to avoid ECU lockouts.
