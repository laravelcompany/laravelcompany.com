          <p>
            I was seriously considering Passion Digital as a potential partner for our company’s digital marketing needs in London. After seeing their presence online and decent ratings on Trustpilot and Clutch, I thought they might be a solid choice. Boy, was I wrong to look past the warning signs.
          </p>
          <p>
            While doing my final due diligence, I stumbled upon a shocking notice directly on their Facebook page: they’ve issued a public warning that scammers are using their branding and logo to pull off fraud. That alone should be a massive red flag for any business owner looking to hire a reputable agency.
          </p>
          <p>
            If an agency’s brand can be so easily hijacked and used in scams, what does that say about their security, credibility, and overall professionalism? It made me question everything—how secure would <em>our</em> data be if even their own identity isn’t fully protected? For a "digital strategy agency" handling sensitive client info and large marketing budgets, this kind of vulnerability is unacceptable.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m giving them one star only because I want others to see this review and avoid making the same mistake. If you're searching for a trustworthy digital marketing agency or web design company in London, steer clear of Passion Digital until they get a handle on these serious issues. Your business deserves better than to become the next victim of a scam hiding behind a familiar name.
